In our linux basis we alredy disus that linux doesnot have file extensions 

it cosiders extensions as filename itself however as user we want know what type of file.
it is easy way of idendifiying is by extensions that is the reason that we always try to make extensions for
the file we create

in shell we are creating scripts and those we are going to give extensions to understand that the shell
script.

we learn bash shell here.
so the file name can be .bash or even a lot of people still use .sh

i prefer using .sh over .bash
